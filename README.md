# oslo_metod_python

NB! This repo is currently in testing. Most things do not work correctly. Use at your own risk!

This is a python implementation of the Oslo method. The goal is that this will become a complete Oslo method ecosystem within Python, which can also be interfaced with other Python packages to do e.g. Bayesian inference.
